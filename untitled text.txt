So the Opponent class should be structured like this:

It's initialized with a smaller deck of cards from the stock deck (7 to start, you don't
need to worry about where it's coming from, though), a difficulty, and an (empty to start) 
deck of books that have been laid down.

The ask method is what needs to be changed:
Check the GoFish file I uploaded a few days ago and complete the
ask method. The ask method will return the opponent's guess. The guess should be based
on difficulty, the contents of the opponent's deck, and the already laidDown books.
For difficulties 1 and 2 (smart and devious), an instance variable recentCard should
also be maintained so that the computer can make informed guesses, based on the most
recent card obtained from going fish(ing)?
